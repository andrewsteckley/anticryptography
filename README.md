# Anticryptography Challenge

**_Can anyone decipher the message contained in the text file: 
`anticrypto_message.txt`?_**

This is a simple experiment in anticryptography, wherein the goal is to create a transmittable message that is *easy* to decipher rather than difficult. Ideally the message contains its own primer to teach one how to read the message.
(Recall the movie "Contact" where Ellie figures out how to read the alien transmission.) 

The message in `anticrypto_message.txt` contains a continuous string of 4,299 binary digits. And it contains a primer as well as a primary message.

Normal communications rely on both sender and reciever having a shared context and a coding system used to encode the message. 
For example, the document you are reading uses the english language and the english alphabet.
But when sender and recceiver have never met and so do not both know a common coding system, then how might they communicate? 
One must create a message that relies on some minimal context that is garanteed to be shared, and then use that to bootstrap the teaching of a coding system.

If you have an affinity for this kind of challenge, take a crack to figuring out the message. 
Please send me your answer (or your questions). you can email me at:

* There is no "trick question" here. 
* The sender (me) *wants* you to succeed in figuring out the message. It helps to remember this when trying to decipher it.
* The file contains the message stored in ASCII text, but the message itself is the continuous string of binary digits -- the 0's oand 1's you see in a simple text editor.

(As soon as anyone has cracked it, I'll post an update here too.)

Good luck!
